# Bank-Customer-Segmentation-Analysis
K-Means

This project aims to segment German bank customers, and various libraries and tools will be used for data processing and clustering. Here is a summary of the key components:
Pandas: It will be used for data frame manipulation. Pandas is a popular library for handling and analyzing structured data.
NumPy: It serves as a resource for linear algebra and numerical operations. NumPy is essential for performing mathematical and array operations efficiently.
Seaborn: This library will create visually appealing and informative data visualizations. Seaborn is built on top of Matplotlib and provides a high-level interface for creating stylish plots.
Matplotlib: It's a fundamental library for data visualization. Matplotlib provides a wide range of tools for creating static, animated, or interactive plots.
Scikit-Learn (sklearn): This machine-learning library will implement the clustering techniques. It offers a wide range of tools for machine learning, including clustering algorithms.
The project will involve preprocessing the data and using two clustering techniques: K-Means, will be imported from Scikit-Learn. K-Means is a centroid-based clustering algorithm.
In summary, the project will use a combination of data manipulation, visualization, and machine learning techniques to segment German bank customers, ultimately aiming to gain insights from the data.
